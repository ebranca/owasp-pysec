# OWASP Python Security Project - PySec

Python Security is a free, open source, OWASP project that aims at creating a hardened version of python that makes it easier for security professionals and developers to write applications more resilient to attacks and manipulations.

The project is designed to explore how web applications can be developed in python by developers approaching the problem from three different angles:

+ Security in python: white-box analysis, structural and functional analysis
+ Security of python: black-box analysis, identify and address security-related issues
+ Security with python: develop security hardened python suitable for high-risk and high-security environments
